# Notes on Book "The Art of Computer Programming"

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

I wanted to read this series for a while, and it might take me forever,
but eventually I will finish reading this series. Not seriously since
it is only part of me learning data structures and algorithms.

## Goal's

    and Neorg is still alpha stage
- [ ] Read and reread the Material

- [x] write a README
- [x] move to Markdown format
