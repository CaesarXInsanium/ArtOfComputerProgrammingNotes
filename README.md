# Notes on Book "The Art of Computer Programming"

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

I wanted to read this series for a while, and it might take me forever,
but eventually I will finish reading this series. Not seriously since
it is only part of me learning data structures and algorithms.

This is only a way to introduce me to some math related to Algorithms,
proofs and Computer Science stuff.

## Goal's

- [x] Take notes on important things
- [ ] finish the exercises
  - currently failing miserably
- [ ] learn how to use ORG Mode on Neovim
  - failed this miserably since ORG mode suck on Neovim
    and Neorg is still alpha stage
- [ ] Reread the Material
- [x] export documents using Pandoc
- [ ] apply for job at Microsoft/Google/Red Hat/System76 and then reject offer, begin startup
- [x] write a README
- [x] move to Markdown format
- [ ] reach section 1.3, then switch over to CLRS

## Overall Book Notes

- procedure for reading chapters on early part of Book 1
- exercises ratings, difficulty scales logarithmic
  - 00: easy
  - 10: think
  - 20: normal problems, should use pen and paper
  - 30: somewhat hard, will require rigor
  - 40: term project
  - 50: research problems

## Procedure For Reading Sections

- Take handwritten notes on long paragraph sections
- explore math concepts
  - in retrospect the author does say to skim the math.
- Finish draft on sketchbook
- finalize in org document
