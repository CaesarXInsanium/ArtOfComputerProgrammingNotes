I wanted to read this series for a while, and it might take me forever,
but eventually I will finish reading this series. Not seriously since it
is only part of me learning data structures and algorithms.

This is only a way to introduce me to some math related to Algorithms,
proofs and Computer Science stuff.

I have decided to give up on this. ## Goal's

- [X] Take notes on important things
- [ ] finish the exercises
  - currently failing miserably
- [X] learn how to use ORG Mode on Neovim
  - failed this miserably since ORG mode sucks on Neovim and Neorg is
    still alpha stage
- [ ] Reread the Material
- [X] export documents using Pandoc
- [ ] apply for a job at Microsoft/Google/Red Hat/System76 and then
  reject the offer, begin a startup
- [X] write a README
- [X] move to Markdown format
- [ ] move back to org format
- [ ] reach section 1.3, then switch over to CLRS

** Overall Book Notes

- procedure for reading chapters on early part of Book 1
- exercises ratings, difficulty scales logarithmic
  - 00: easy
  - 10: think
  - 20: normal problems, should use pen and paper
  - 30: somewhat hard, will require rigor
  - 40: term project
  - 50: research problems

** Procedure For Reading Sections
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: procedure-for-reading-sections
:END:
- Take handwritten notes on long paragraph sections
- explore math concepts
  - in retrospect the author does say to skim the math.
- Finish draft on sketchbook
- finalize in org document

** Questions to Asks Self

- Do I really want to spend time on creating a proper implementation of the MIX
  virtual machine and assembler?
- If so what is the prerequisite knowledge required in order to attemp such a daunting
  task?
- When will I try again to read the knowledge that is present in the series?
- Is there some other things that are more deserving of my time?
